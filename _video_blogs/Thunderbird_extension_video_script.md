## 🎬 Scene 2: Introduction - Who Am I? (0:30-1:30)

### Visual
- **[SHOW]**: Your recorded footage starting the project
- **[OVERLAY]**: Text showing "Python, Flask, DevOps"
- **[CUT TO]**: Browser with JavaScript documentation tabs

### Script
```
"I'm John, a Python developer. Flask, DevOps, automating deployments - 
that's my comfort zone.

JavaScript? Well... [SHOW error: 'undefined is not a function']
Yeah, that's my relationship with JavaScript.

But I needed to build a Thunderbird extension for Trello integration, 
and I had two choices:

[SHOW two paths on screen]
Path 1: Spend a week learning JavaScript
Path 2: Try this new AI tool called Warp

At 4:18 PM, I chose Path 2. Here's what happened..."
```

### B-Roll Needed
- Your terminal with Python code
- JavaScript error messages
- Clock showing 16:18

## 🎬 Scene 3: The Traditional Path Reality Check (1:30-2:30)

### Visual
- **[SHOW]**: Your slide with time estimates table
- **[HIGHLIGHT]**: Each row as you mention it
- **[CUT TO]**: Your mental state progression

### Script
```
"First, let's be honest about what the traditional path looks like 
for a Python developer:

[POINT to each item]
- Learning JavaScript basics: 4-6 hours
- Understanding npm and Node.js: Another 2 hours
- Extension architecture? What's a manifest.json? 3-4 hours
- Writing JavaScript that actually works: 4-6 hours
- Debugging 'this' binding issues: Kill me now... 6-8 hours

Total: 34-45 hours. Basically a full work week.

And here's my actual thought process when I tried:
[SHOW mental state slide]
- Hour 0: 'Why am I doing this manually?'
- Hour 1: 'Can I write this in Python somehow?'
- Hour 2: 'Is JavaScript worth my time?'
- Hour 3: 'Nope.'
- Hour 4: 'Hello Warp.'"
```

### On-Screen Graphics
- Time estimate table
- Mental state progression
- Clock ticking animation

## 🎬 Scene 4: The Warp Experiment Begins (2:30-4:00)

### Visual
- **[SHOW]**: Screen recording - Opening Warp terminal
- **[TYPE]**: First command in real-time
- **[SHOW]**: File structure being generated

### Script
```
"4:18 PM. I open Warp and type something radical - 
I just describe what I want in plain English:

[TYPE slowly, with emphasis]
'I'm a Python developer. Create a Thunderbird extension project 
for Trello integration. Include all setup, dependencies, 
and explain the structure in Python terms.'

[PAUSE as generation happens]

Watch this... 

[Files appear]
Look! It's creating the entire project structure.
And see these comments? 
'package.json is like requirements.txt'
'node_modules is like your virtual environment'

It's literally translating JavaScript to Python concepts for me!"
```

### Screen Recording Focus
- Typing the command
- File tree generation
- Highlight Python-friendly comments

---

## 🎬 Scene 5: API Integration Magic (4:00-5:30)

### Visual
- **[SPLIT SCREEN]**: Python code (left) vs JavaScript generation (right)
- **[HIGHLIGHT]**: Similar patterns between languages
- **[SHOW]**: API working in browser

### Script
```
"Now for the API integration. In Python, I know exactly how to do this:
[SHOW Python code]

So I ask Warp:
'Create a Trello API client similar to Python's requests library. 
Include error handling like try/except.'

[Generation starts]

Look at this! It's not just generating JavaScript - 
it's explaining it in Python terms:

'fetch() is like requests.get()'
'async/await is similar to Python's async/await'
'catch is like except in Python'

[Point to working code]
5 minutes in, and I have a working API client. 
In manual mode, I'd still be reading documentation about promises!"
```

---

## 🎬 Scene 6: The UI - Frontend for a Backend Dev (5:30-6:30)

### Visual
- **[SHOW]**: Warp generating popup.html and popup.js
- **[HIGHLIGHT]**: Comments explaining DOM manipulation
- **[DEMO]**: Click through the working extension

### Script
```
"Here's where it gets interesting. I need to build a UI.
As a backend developer, DOM manipulation is my nightmare.

But watch Warp handle this:

[Show generation]
'This file is like a Flask route handler but runs in the browser'
'addEventListener is like @app.route'
'document.getElementById is like getting form data in Flask'

It's translating frontend concepts to backend patterns I understand!

[Click through extension]
And look - it actually works! Dropdowns populate, buttons click, 
forms submit. No hours of debugging why 'this' is undefined!"
```

### Visual Elements
- HTML/JS generation
- Comments highlighted
- Working UI demonstration

---

## 🎬 Scene 7: The 23-Minute Mark - Success! (6:30-7:30)

### Visual

### Script
```
"And here we are. 4:42 PM. 
23 minutes and 8 seconds after starting.

[Click email → Create Trello Card]

Watch this... I right-click an email...
Select 'Create Trello Card'...

[Show Trello board]

BOOM! There it is! A working integration!

[Show timestamp proof]
Started: 16:18:52
First card: 16:42:00
Total time: 23 minutes

From zero JavaScript knowledge to working extension. 
Not a prototype. Not a demo. A actual, working extension!"
```

### Critical Footage

## 🎬 Scene 8: What I Love About Warp (7:30-8:30)

### Visual
- **[SHOW]**: Warp Rules configuration
- **[SHOW]**: Docker rules example
- **[SHOW]**: Agent Mode with auto-approve

### Script
```
"Let me show you why Warp is different from other AI tools:

[Show Rules screen]
First - Rules. I can tell Warp my preferences once, 
and it remembers them for the entire project.

[Show Docker rules]
Like these Docker rules - it knows I always want specific configurations.

[Show Agent Mode]
And Agent Mode? It can make intelligent decisions without 
constantly asking for confirmation. 

This isn't just code completion - it's like having a senior 
JavaScript developer who speaks Python sitting next to me!"
```

### Screen Captures Needed
- Rules interface
- Docker rules example
- Agent Mode in action

## 🎬 Scene 9: Adding CI/CD - The Polish (8:30-9:30)

### Visual
- **[SHOW]**: GitHub Actions workflow generation
- **[SHOW]**: Successful pipeline run
- **[SHOW]**: Released XPI file

### Script
```
"After the initial success, I spent a few more hours adding CI/CD.
Even here, Warp helped:

[Show command]
'Create GitHub Actions workflow for a Thunderbird extension.
I'm familiar with Python GitHub Actions.'

[Show generated YAML]
See? It explains: 'npm ci is like pip install -r requirements.txt'
'npm test is like pytest'

[Show successful build]
And now we have automated testing, building, and releases.
Total time including CI/CD: Still less than learning JavaScript basics!"
```

### Visual Elements
- YAML file generation
- GitHub Actions running
- Successful release

## 🎬 Scene 10: The Reality Check - Pros and Cons (9:30-10:30)

### Visual
- **[SPLIT SCREEN]**: What worked vs What didn't
- **[SHOW]**: Actual limitations encountered

### Script
```
"Let's be real - it wasn't perfect:

WHAT WORKED:
✅ 23 minutes to working extension
✅ No JavaScript knowledge required
✅ working-quality code
✅ Learned patterns from examples, if you looked at it

WHAT DIDN'T:
❌ Linux shortcuts don't work properly
❌ No built-in editor (that I could find)
❌ Still needed 2-4 hours for CI/CD setup
❌ You don't become a JS expert

But here's the thing: I shipped a working product in 23 minutes.
The alternative was a week of frustration."
```

### Graphics
- Pro/Con comparison
- Time saved visualization

## 🎬 Scene 11: Key Insights & Lessons (10:30-11:30)

### Visual
- **[SHOW]**: Confidence graph comparison
- **[SHOW]**: Productivity metrics
- **[TEXT OVERLAY]**: Key takeaways

### Script
```
"Here's what I learned from this experiment:

1. You don't need to learn JavaScript first
   Warp translates your existing knowledge

2. It's not about being lazy
   It's about being productive - ship first, learn later if needed

3. The confidence boost is real
   Instead of 'I can't do JavaScript'
   It becomes 'I can build JavaScript apps'

4. AI doesn't replace learning, it accelerates it
   I learned more from reading Warp's code than from tutorials

The future isn't about knowing every language.
It's about leveraging AI to translate what you know 
into what you need to build."
```

### Visual Elements
- Animated graphs
- Key points appearing

"So here's my challenge to you:

If you're a Python developer avoiding JavaScript projects,
or any developer facing a language you don't know -
give Warp a try.

What could you build in 23 minutes?
